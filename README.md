# Spacecraft-Maneuver-Detection

This repository contains a project aimed at detecting spacecraft maneuvers using machine learning techniques and data analysis. The goal is to identify key events or deviations in spacecraft trajectories that indicate deliberate changes in velocity or direction, such as orbit adjustments.
# Features

    Data Preprocessing: Handles spacecraft telemetry data and prepares it for analysis.
    Maneuver Detection: Implements algorithms to detect sudden changes in spacecraft velocity or trajectory.
    Machine Learning Models: Uses supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to classify and predict spacecraft maneuvers.
    Visualization: Plots spacecraft paths and maneuvers using tools like matplotlib for better insight into the detected events.
    Evaluation Metrics: Provides metrics such as accuracy and recall to evaluate the detection model's performance.

# Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    Required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. Install them with:

    bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Sreejeet1998/Spacecraft-Maneuver-Detection-.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd Spacecraft-Maneuver-Detection-

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Data Preparation: Ensure that you have spacecraft telemetry data in the required format (e.g., CSV).

    Model Training: Train the machine learning model on the telemetry data to detect maneuvers.

    bash

python train_model.py --data telemetry_data.csv

Maneuver Detection: After training, use the model to detect maneuvers on new data.

bash

python detect_maneuver.py --input new_telemetry_data.csv

Visualization: Use the visualization scripts to plot the trajectory and detected maneuvers.

# Example:

bash

    python plot_maneuver.py --data telemetry_data.csv

# Customization

You can experiment with different machine learning models, change preprocessing steps, or adjust hyperparameters to improve detection accuracy. The project is modular, allowing for easy extensions.
